# Low- and high-order FC network estimation based on MVND.Several illustrations:
1.fmriEMCINC.mat is about MCI. 
2. Run MVND.m for constructing low- and high-order FC networks based on PC methods (with different parameters); then, run classifier.m for selecting optimal regularized parameters (based on an inner LOO cross validation) and classification.
3. The codes of the proposed brain network construction algorithms are created based on Liu et al.'s SLEP toolbox (http://www.yelab.net/software/SLEP/). Classification is based on Lin et al.'s LIBSVM toolbox (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/). All copyright of these toolboxes reserved by the original authors.
